# Week 2 #
__Progress__:
- We have dataframes for all of days from the start of school to 10/31. 
- Most of the data only includes cases and deaths though, so we need to move to the more data-rich covid daily reports dataset
  - It can be found here: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports]

__This Week's Objectives__
- Generate Dataframes *for all days starting from start of school to now* from the new dataset
- Brainstorm Ideas for how to Visualize the Data; during the meeting itself, we came up with a few:
  - Use scatterplot of counties' lat and longitude to overlay data over a map of illinois
  - If we are looking at data across time and only for 1 county, we should probably use a line plot
  - If we are looking at data across counties and only for a single time period/day, we should probably use a scatter plot
- Make Basic Visualizations on County Data to familiarize yourself with MatPlotLib and Pandas

__Action Items for Week 2:__
- Make Dataframes for Covid-Daily-Reports dataset if not done already: __Everyone__
- Brainstorm Ideas on How to Visualize Data: __Everyone__
- Make Basic Visualizations on County Data for Familiarize yourself with MPL/PD
